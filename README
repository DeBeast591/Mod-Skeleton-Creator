The Mod Skeleton Creator is a simple Python 3 Tkinter app that makes a skeleton for a tModLoader mod.

RUNNING:
1. Download Python 3.x
2. Download the Tkinter module (Linux: sudo apt install python3-tk)
3. Go to where this was downloaded (Open the Terminal/Command Line) (Linux+Mac: cd ~/Downloads/ModSkeletonCreator/   Windows: cd C:\path\to\where\you\downloaded\this)
4. Run (python3 main.py)

INFO:
- If the mod already exists in this folder then it will make an error.

CHANGELOG:
VERSION 0.1:
  - Made this...

PLANS:
  - Commands that change dependent on your OS. Ie. Version 0.1 - Running a Linux command on Windows and making error, Version 0.2 - Running a Windows command on Windows and working
  - Make the GUI look betters
